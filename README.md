# Parallel-Computing

The objective of this work presented by these Slides is to design and develop an application aimed at managing student averages. The project is part of the development of parallel computing and calculation grid techniques in everyday applications. It is in this context that this work is based on techniques allowing simultaneous access to the data relating to this application in order to benefit from the advantages of time and computation capacity to ensure parallelism. Nevertheless, a very important point is to consider: access management to critical sections.
